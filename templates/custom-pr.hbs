# Create a Custom PR Summary!

You can effortlessly generate dynamic summaries and PR comments using Handlebars.

Your templates will be converted into markdown and rendered in Github!

## Example: Generating a Summary

Below is a sample table that displays a summary of your test results, you might have seen this one somewhere!

| **Tests 📝** | **Passed ✅** | **Failed ❌** | **Skipped ⏭️** | **Pending ⏳** | **Other ❓** | **Flaky 🍂** | **Duration ⏱️** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {{results.summary.tests}} | {{results.summary.passed}} | {{results.summary.failed}} | {{results.summary.skipped}} | {{results.summary.pending}} | {{results.summary.other}} | {{countFlaky results.tests}} | {{formatDuration results.summary.start results.summary.stop}} |

As you can see, you can easily reference and display properties from your CTRF report to create a detailed and customised summaries.

Additionally, you can utilize custom methods like countFlaky and formatDuration:

**Count of flaky tests:** {{countFlaky results.tests}}
**Duration of execution:** {{formatDuration results.summary.start results.summary.stop}}

Remember, you're writing markdown enhanced with Handlebars! So feel free to use all the features and flexibility that markdown offers.

## Example: Iterating Over the Tests Array

To generate a report of the failed tests, we'll iterate over the CTRF `tests` array:

| **Name** | **Status** | **Failure Message** |
| --- | --- | --- |
{{#each results.tests}}
  {{#if (eq status "failed")}}
  | {{name}} | {{status}} ❌ | {{#if message}}{{message}}{{else}}No failure message{{/if}} |
  {{/if}}
{{/each}}

You might have noticed, this one is using a helper called `eq`. You can use this for property comparisons directly within your template logic.
